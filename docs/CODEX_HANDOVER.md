# Continue here — ELHAFEZ BOAT

## Platform audit checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Migration 041, restricted API and bilingual console provide exact actor/company/action filters, bounded UTC date ranges, stable ID cursor pagination and explicitly loaded-record JSON export. Direct table/application-role access remains denied. API build, web TypeScript, lint and dedicated SQL smoke passed. Continue with granular operator permissions and MFA; product remains partial. No screenshots or visual acceptance are requested in this sprint.


## Mandatory continuous Git checkpoints

Owner instruction applies to all current/future work: after each coherent stable functional unit, run appropriate quick checks, commit and push immediately to `feat/complete-premium-saas` / existing Draft PR #1. Target checkpoints every 10–15 minutes while recoverable changes exist. Verify clean/status and remote HEAD after each push, then continue without asking approval. Do not wait for a batch/session or final acceptance tests. If limits approach, prioritize a safe `wip:` checkpoint with feature gates and an honest continuation note. Never stage .env files, secrets, generated/temporary files; `.env.example` must contain placeholders only. No new branch/PR, main merge or production deployment.

## Continuous sprint verification — 2026-10-23

Four functional checkpoints were committed and pushed separately on the existing branch/PR: `2a67d3f` (CRM work management), `5d6b768` (shared delivery-account budgets), `3c3f07f` (department lifecycle/response reporting), and `00a0a55` (platform directory search/pagination). Each received targeted checks before push; remote HEAD was verified. No new branch/PR, merge or deployment.

Final development verification passed: full API/Next production build and TypeScript, ESLint, all 47 API unit tests; four new CRM-work/delivery-account/department/platform-directory smoke suites and seven existing core/business/sprint/worker/reliability/major/billing-branding suites. Incremental migrations 037–040 and the clean-schema validation chain through 040 passed. External delivery, paid AI calls and live platform-administrator activation remain disabled. Comprehensive browser, security, performance and visual acceptance remain deferred.

Continue directly with platform audit pagination and granular operator authorization/MFA, then remaining billing/catalog/invoice lifecycle and custom-domain host routing/TLS. Batch 2 still needs advanced automation graphs/integration policies, AI audit/pricing/source lifecycle, provider-policy activation acceptance and CRM historical/large-export refinements. Department metrics use current assignment/target and message creation timestamps; provider quotas are operator-configured limits, not automatic discovery. Batch 4 and final visual previews/owner approval remain open. Do not declare PRODUCT BUILD COMPLETE. Maintain immediate commit/push after each stable unit and 10–15-minute recoverable checkpoints.

## Continuous checkpoint — platform company/user directory

Migration 040 adds an explicitly granted security-definer paged directory for the restricted platform DB role. Platform API validates kind/search/page/limit; console searches and pages all company/user records while preserving existing management actions. Literal search and stable date/ID ordering avoid wildcard injection and unstable page boundaries. The application SQL role and tenant JWTs cannot use the directory. Legacy snapshot remains bounded for compatibility; platform audit paging, MFA and granular operator roles remain open. API/web TypeScript, ESLint, migration and `smoke-platform-directory.mjs` pass. Next: broader development regression/build for saved checkpoints; do not pause continuous commits until a whole batch finishes.

## Continuous checkpoint — department operations and response metrics

Migration 039 adds non-destructive archive/restore, update revisions and audit. Existing departments API/UI now edits name/membership/response target and preserves historical conversation links when archived; Inbox refuses new assignments to archived departments with a shared row lock. Date-scoped aggregates and UI show conversation/answered/unanswered/average response and current-target breaches. Metrics use UTC wall-clock message creation time for public staff messages with sent status, and current target/assignment; they are not historical business-calendar or provider-acknowledgement SLA certification. Targeted API/web TypeScript, ESLint, migration and `smoke-departments.mjs` pass. Next: full development regression/build across the saved checkpoints, then remaining billing/platform role/UX work. Continuous push checkpoints remain mandatory.

## Continuous checkpoint — shared delivery account limits

Migration 038 adds tenant-owned operator-defined Meta/web account groups. Channels can share a group through the policy UI. The existing outbound worker and web campaign dispatcher use one PostgreSQL permit service for channel interval + account interval + UTC daily attempt caps. Locks serialize cross-channel/cross-worker reservations, and rollback releases uncommitted permits. Disabled groups block dispatch; provider mismatches/cross-tenant assignments are refused. Uncertain provider attempts stay counted. These are configured operational limits, not automatic discovery/approval of provider quotas. Direct web chat remains immediate. API/web TypeScript, ESLint, migration and `smoke-delivery-accounts.mjs` pass. No external sending enabled.

## Current checkpoint — CRM sales and follow-ups

Migration 037 adds deal ownership, task update timestamps and indexes/audit triggers. `/crm/deals` and `/crm/tasks` now filter/search/page; bounded filtered exports refuse silent truncation. Existing PATCH endpoints support titles/amounts/currency/ownership and task due dates/assignment, with optional revision checks and member validation. The connected bilingual `/dashboard/crm/work` screen links from CRM and edits existing records. Existing create/stage/status callers remain compatible. API build, web TypeScript, ESLint, migration and `scripts/smoke-crm-work.mjs` validate this slice. Next: cross-channel/provider-account pacing using existing delivery policies, then remaining SaaS/UX work.

## Major product implementation checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Started from verified local/remote `1f338897cceb119577d9093c2b95d43e91cb8f35`, same branch and Draft PR #1. New migrations 028–036 build on the existing outbox and tenant RLS; no parallel scheduler or production deployment.

- Knowledge: durable text/FAQ/URL/file jobs, persisted file extraction, prepared chunks/vector batches, blocked/failed/canceled states, resume/progress UI, atomic conservative monthly embedding reservations, durable cached effects and audited uncertainty reconciliation. Paid generation/query/ingestion calls remain disabled. Index replacement is atomic after complete processing; the prior index survives failures.
- Campaigns: explicit per-channel marketing policy, shared external-send pacing across replicas/campaigns, paced web campaign events, Meta response-window checks, inbound opt-out keywords and existing consent checks. Provider-wide account caps and complete external Meta policy acceptance remain open.
- CRM: real searchable merge-impact preview with profile differences, dependency counts, consent result, identity conflicts and Inbox links. Unsafe identity merges still require manual review; deal/task filtering/editing remains open.
- Automation: reopen/edit existing sequences and bounded branch/condition groups; encrypted, rotatable host-bound Bearer secret references; durable per-rule failure attribution and safe event retry UI. Nested arbitrary graphs and extended integration policies remain open.
- Platform administration: separately signed/purposed short-lived platform sessions, immutable operator allowlist, separate least-privilege database connection/role, database-backed sign-in limits and audited company/subscription/user/plan operations. Console is disabled until external operator configuration; tenant roles cannot activate it. See PLATFORM_ADMIN_ACTIVATION.md. Pagination/MFA/granular operator roles remain open.
- Sessions: backing session IDs/user versions for new access tokens, self-service session list/revoke, global operator revoke, account/tenant suspension enforcement, and live SSE revocation checks. Legacy access tokens without IDs retain their short access lifetime unless globally revoked; cookie migration/recovery remain open.
- Billing: durable owner-requested Stripe reconciliation jobs, disabled-by-default activation gate, linked customer/subscription ownership checks, cached retrieval and existing event dedupe/order application. No Stripe calls or real account setup occurred.
- UX: original SVG navigation icons, connected bilingual job/policy/merge/sequence/platform/session screens. Final identity/design approval and standalone visual previews remain deferred to completed-product review.

Validation: production API/Next build and TypeScript, ESLint, 47 unit tests (including active SSE revocation), migrations through 036 on a fresh validation database, core/business/sprint/billing development smokes and `smoke-major.mjs`. Major smoke covers gated jobs and durable file extraction, a real vector index built from mocked embeddings, cached replay/concurrent quota reservation, opt-out/policy isolation, merge preview, encrypted secrets/saved branches, platform token/SQL-role boundaries, suspension, session revocation and blocked/mocked Stripe reconciliation. No paid/provider network calls, live admin credentials or comprehensive final acceptance were used.

Next: finish provider/account-wide campaign caps, CRM deal/task workflows and operator roles/MFA, complete billing/catalog/invoice lifecycle and custom-domain host/TLS integration, then remaining UX/unified bilingual controls and final visual previews. Product build remains incomplete.

## Multi-feature implementation checkpoint — 2026-10-23

Started from verified local/remote `6b4f68f0468f503469ce9ac581a97861af624e16` on `feat/complete-premium-saas`, same open Draft PR #1. No new branch/PR, merge or production deployment.

- CRM lifecycle: migrations 022–023; normalized identity matching, audited soft merge/reparenting with original campaign ledger preservation and conservative consent, archive/restore, bulk custom fields, durable chunked import/export with progress/cancel/results UI. Distinct identities on the same channel require manual review; merged source records are retained.
- Campaigns: migration 024; draft revision checks, editing, starter copy, versioned rescheduling/cancel, canonical recipient dedupe/frequency checks. Website widget opt-out and pre-send consent checks are connected. No external delivery occurred.
- AI: migration 025; shared Anthropic/OpenAI implementations, encrypted key rotation, flow/channel/default assignments and UI; flow routing is propagated through resume/delay. Paid calls remain disabled. Knowledge ingestion/embedding recovery remains open.
- Automations: bounded AND/OR groups, then/otherwise branches, ordered visual step cards, gated HTTPS actions using the existing SSRF helper/effect ledger, and audited schedule/follow-up cancel/reschedule. Arbitrary graph editing, secret references and detailed failure attribution remain open.
- Batch 3: real tenant/date-scoped reports and exports; migration 026 branding/domain ownership models and UI with plan enforcement and widget integration; migration 027 atomic signed Stripe event dedupe/order guard and tenant event history. Domain verification does not activate hosting/TLS. Super Admin is not implemented.

Verification: API + Next production build/TypeScript, ESLint and 46 API unit tests; fresh database migration chain 001–027 and incremental migration checks; core, business, worker, reliability, sprint and billing/branding development smokes. Sprint smoke covers multi-batch jobs and row errors, merge data retention/consent, archive/restore, bulk custom-field rollback, authenticated widget opt-out, routing/key rotation, OR/branches, schedule edits, campaign revisions and report isolation. Billing smoke uses local signed fixtures only; OpenAI tests mock fetch. No comprehensive browser/security/load/visual acceptance was run.

Continue directly with durable knowledge ingestion/embedding budgets, channel-wide campaign pacing/provider policies and remaining CRM conflict/graph editing, then separate Super Admin authorization/administration and domain hosting/TLS. Read REMAINING_WORK.md for exact bounds. Batches 2–3 remain partial; final design/Batch 4 is deferred per owner instructions. This is not PRODUCT BUILD COMPLETE.

## Checkout and delivery boundary

Use `/workspace/Boat-two`, branch `feat/complete-premium-saas`, existing **Draft PR #1**: https://github.com/hendhafez5566-arch/Boat-two/pull/1. This continuation started from verified local/remote `f1292123a60acd19e12562b41e4d3c829b337d46`. Read `git status --short` and `git log -3 --oneline` for the latest pushed checkpoint. Never create another branch/PR, merge main or deploy production without explicit owner approval.

Read PRODUCT_COMPLETION_MATRIX.md, REMAINING_WORK.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md. Do not repeat the original repository audit or rebuild the connected CRM/marketing/event models. The owner authorized source changes, migrations, tests, commits and push; the old onboarding-only source restriction is superseded for this product task.

Source implementation checkpoint: `f091db0613297d4ab4c8560274017bc0f5daa78b`. A following documentation commit records handover; use current Git HEAD.

## Current construction architecture

- `events/`: durable domain outbox, effect cache; DatabaseService reuses tenant transactions and provides separate durable-effect connections. Message persistence/dispatch is atomic. Listener failures propagate. Future scheduled work cannot block immediate aggregate work.
- `messaging/outbound.service.ts`: durable send leases, rejection retry, unknown-delivery suppression. Delivery UI supports audited manual reconciliation before confirmed failed work is retried.
- Shared realtime is PostgreSQL `realtime_events -> stream_events`, materialized after source commit so replay cursors cannot skip late transactions. SSE checks membership each batch. Redis remains provisioned; do not introduce another competing event transport/automation engine.
- `business/`: CRM/consent, campaign recipient events, typed business rules/actions and departments, all RLS-scoped. Rule/root/contact uniqueness suppresses loops. Delayed follow-ups reuse domain events.
- Flow components are existing published flows, frozen into parent versions at publish. Event triggers and the beginner wizard use the existing engine/editor.
- AI tenant agents/providers/tools reuse the existing generation/retrieval service. Embedding provider/ingestion still uses environment configuration; do not imply tenant generation credentials configure embeddings.

## Start

```bash
export PATH=/workspace/.boat-tools/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
cd /workspace/Boat-two
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_isready -U postgres -d chatbot
pnpm migrate # all migrations 001–021 required
pnpm dev:api
# Another session, same PATH/cwd:
pnpm dev:web
```

Wait for clean TypeScript compilation and Nest startup; require GET `/health` status=ok/db=up before requests. `scripts/dev-api.mjs` preserves decorator metadata. Do not revert to tsx API watch or `--noCheck`. Retain ignored `.env`; never print/overwrite keys. The clean migration validation DB is `boat_business_validation`; earlier `boat_core_validation` is also a local test DB. They contain no production data.

`EXTERNAL_DELIVERY_ENABLED=false` and **independent** `AI_PROVIDER_CALLS_ENABLED=false` are defaults. No real provider credentials/accounts or paid calls were used. Meta connection buttons require operator configuration/permissions; consult INTEGRATION_ACTIVATION.md. WhatsApp unsupported template variants cannot send; text BODY variants are the implemented slice.

## Development checks

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm --filter api test # 44 passed; no skips
node scripts/smoke-core.mjs
node --env-file=.env scripts/smoke-worker.mjs
node --env-file=.env scripts/smoke-business.mjs
node --env-file=.env scripts/smoke-reliability.mjs
```

Run smoke scripts against a stable API, not while editing TypeScript/hot-reloading it. To check multiple replicas, build first, then from apps/api start `API_PORT=4100 node --env-file=../../.env dist/main.js` and similarly 4101. Set `SMOKE_API_URL=http://localhost:4100` for the smoke process; both workers share PostgreSQL. Stop only your test replicas afterward. Test fixtures use explicit local-only names and no provider calls. Smoke scripts create isolated test tenants; the business script accelerates only its own delayed event fixture.

All 44 tests, core/worker/business/reliability smoke, full build/lint and migration chain passed in this continuation. Basic HTTP route checks are not browser acceptance. Full final security/load/visual/provider acceptance is deliberately not claimed.

## Direct continuation point

Finish the explicit Batch 2 gaps in REMAINING_WORK.md. In particular: CRM contact merge/reparenting and pipeline/bulk controls; durable knowledge ingestion/embedding budgets and richer agent routing/providers; campaign draft editing/opt-out collection/compliance and analytics; OR/branch automation and graphical sequences. Keep current-contact AI tools limited to explicit permissions and keep unknown external results non-retryable until reconciled.

Then Batch 3 starts with real ledger-backed reporting (messages/conversations, campaign_recipients/outbound_jobs, ai_runs, crm_deals and automation_runs), date filters and exports, followed by Stripe event reliability, platform-admin privilege boundary and verified white-label domains/entitlements. Batch 4 completes legacy bilingual/mobile/accessibility flows, template/wizard integration and operator documentation. Do not insert fake metrics or start full release acceptance prematurely.

## CRM continuation — 2026-10-23

Started from verified local/remote `e3f714e5d7bd5c15a3f6781bdfac4d3f3bca7ba8`, same branch and Draft PR #1. Added connected sales-pipeline editing/removal and safe stage remapping; deal writes share pipeline locks with configuration changes. Bulk contact lifecycle/owner/additive-tag edits are atomic, tenant scoped and restricted to owner/admin; the UI supports selecting up to 100 contacts. No new schema is required.

Verification: full API/Next build and TypeScript passed; ESLint passed; 44 API unit tests passed. Expanded business smoke passed against a stable compiled local API, including rejected unsafe stage deletion, stage remapping, empty/occupied pipeline removal, cross-tenant rejection, successful bulk edits and rollback on a missing contact. External sending and paid AI calls remain disabled. No final browser/security/performance/visual acceptance was performed.

Batch 2 is still partial; Batches 3–4 remain unfinished. Immediate next implementation: safe duplicate-contact merging with identity/consent/campaign-ledger preservation, then remaining campaign/AI/automation work described in REMAINING_WORK.md. This checkpoint does not declare product completion.
